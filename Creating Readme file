README (as the name suggests: “read me”) is the first file one should read when starting a new project. It's a set of useful information about a project and a kind 
of manual or you can create a personal Readme file from your "personal" Repository for your Github Account which acts as your Github Account's "Bio " .

**FORMATTING**
Every Good Readme file needs a bit of formatting to make it look more pleasing and to highlight any important keywords or sentences or headers . The formatting 
syntaxes are :

1)**Bold** :	"** **" or "__ __"	command/control + b	**This is bold text**	This is bold text
2)*Italic* :	"* *" or "_ _"	command/control + i	*This text is italicized*	This text is italicized
3)~~Strikethrough~~ :	"~~ ~~"		~~This was mistaken text~~	This was mistaken text
4)**Bold and _nested_ _italic_**	: "** **" and "_ _"		**This text is _extremely_ important**	This text is extremely important
5)***All bold and italic***	: "*** ***"		***All this text is important***	All this text is important


**URLs**
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut 
command + k to create a link.

Ex: This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


**Insert Images**
You can add images to your Readme file by doing the following :
1) Open an issue in your repository ,
