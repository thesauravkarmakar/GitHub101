    **Milestone** are groups of issues that that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. It is commonly used for software development in many ways.

    **Labels** are great way to organize different types of issues. We can filter by one or many labels at once.

    **Assignees** are the person that's responsile for moving the issue forward. Assignees are selected by the owner of the repository.
